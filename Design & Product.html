About Department

<P style="line-height: 2;">
    Product design as a verb is to create a new product to be sold by a business to its customers.[1] A very broad coefficient and effective generation and development of ideas through a process that leads to new products.[2] Thus, it is a major aspect of new product development.

Product design process: the set of strategic and tactical activities, from idea generation to commercialization, used to create a product design. In a systematic approach, product designers conceptualize and evaluate ideas, turning them into tangible inventions and products. The product designer's role is to combine art, science, and technology to create new products that people can use. Their evolving role has been facilitated by digital tools that now allow designers to do things that include communicate, visualize, analyze, 3D modeling and actually produce tangible ideas in a way that would have taken greater human resources in the past.
Manufacturing engineering is the field of engineering that designs and optimizes the manufacturing process, or the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification. These materials are then modified through manufacturing to become the desired product.</p>
<p>
The product design process, as expressed by Koberg and Bagnell, typically involves three main aspects:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Analysis</li>
    <li>Concept</li>
    <li>Synthesis</li>
</ul>




    
    <h2> Vision:</h2>
    <p style="line-height: 2;">
       
        The goal of a product vision is to provide a clear and compelling picture of the future state of the product, including its purpose, value proposition, and long-term goals, that guides the team's efforts and decision-making. In this post, we'll look at how your team can collaborate to create a clear, concise product vision.

<h2> Mission:</h2>
    
      <p  style="line-height: 2;" > DFM describes the process of designing or engineering a product in order to facilitate the manufacturing methods to reduce manufacturing costs, improve yields and assure high product quality.
